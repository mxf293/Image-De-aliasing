# U-Net Based Image De-aliasing
Learn and remove the 2D image aliasing artifacts caused by undersampled Fourier space using a modified U-Net structure.

### Introduction
MRI raw data are measured in the Fourier space (k-space) and images are obtained by performing the inverse transform of the k-space data. But in order to accelerate the MRI scan, some recent studies start to sample only a small portion of the k-space. In the example shown below, the k-space is randomly undersampled by a factor of ten and it results in a ringing aliasing artifact in the image. The objective of this work is to remove the aliasing artifact in the image and recover the clear image using a deep learning model.

### Model Input and Output Data
The data used in this program are from the online [IXI Dataset](http://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/). 20,000 T2-weighted images from 200 subjects (100 different slices per subject) are gathered for the following demonstration. Aliased images are generated by applying a sparse k-space mask to the Fourier transform of the ground truth image and then performing the inverse Fourier transform.

### Deep Learning Structure: Modified U-Net
The model employed in this work is based on [U-Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597). The specific structure consists a down-convolution path and an up-convolution path with skip connections. The idea is that the features extracted during the down-sampling path as well as the up-convolution path are all used to recover the final aliasing free image. The convolutional layers are 3 by 3 filters with ReLU activation function and zero-paddings. The upsampling layer increases its input size by 2 with bi-linear interpolations.The original U-Net is developed for object segmentation where it is a pixel-wise binary classification problem and therefore softmax activation function was used in the last layer. In this work, the activation function in the last layer is linear so that it outputs continuous values. The loss function is the mean square error. Adam optimizer is chosen with a learning rate of 1e-3.

#### Training
The dataset is split into 95% training set and 5% test set. In order to monitor the progress of loss and prevent overfitting, the training set is further divided into 95% actual training set and 5% validation set. Since no regularizer is incorporated, early stopping is used. The program is written with Keras package and run on four NVIDIA K80 (12G) GPUs.

### Results and Evaluation
The power of the U-Net de-aliasing is showcased in the figure below. The modified U-Net model is able to remove the ringing artifact and the recon image presents much sharper edges and more detailed structures than the aliased image. Quantitatively, cosine similarity is used to evaluate the distance between the aliased/reconstructed images and the ground truth image. The average cosine distance between the aliased images and the ground truth images is 0.1085 whereas its counterpart between U-Net reconstructed images and the ground truth images is 0.0349.
